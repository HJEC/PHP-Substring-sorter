### Description:

This simple page was built in PHP to create a simple function that prompts the user to enter some text into a textarea and click a submit button. A post request is then generated which takes the provided text and runs it through a function which splits the full string into an array of sub-strings, alphabetises those sub-strings and then sends it back to the user in a new text-area.

Currently the function will convert all text to lowercase as the <strong>PHP sort()</strong> function gives capital letters higher precedence and will always put them at the start of the string.

### Insights:

I've been interested with the idea of learning <strong>PHP</strong> and using virtual machines for a while, so I created this as a first experiment with setting up environments with <strong>Vagrant</strong> and <strong>VirtualBox</strong> to run the <strong>Apache Server</strong>.

It was quite a challenge getting my head around the initial set-up and getting a feel for how PHP works, but I enjoyed experimenting with a different workflow and I can really see the potential power of serving data with PHP embedded in the HTML.

This was only a quick educational project to teach myself the fundamentals, so there's definitely a lot of tightening up I could do and more functionality I could add. After a day of setting up vagrant and virtual box, this page was completed in about 4 hours.
